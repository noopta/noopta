### Hello hello ðŸ‘‹

My name's Anupta and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Toronto-Dominion Bank, based in Toronto, Ontario.

I enjoy coding in my spare time, whether it be competitive programming, side projects, hackathons, or my own side projects. You'll find projects here in various languages, but I'm a back-end developer at the core. Can't get enough of highly performant Kotlin, Java, Go, and C code :)
